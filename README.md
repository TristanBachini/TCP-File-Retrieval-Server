# TCP Server for File Retrieval

Welcome to my project! This project involves a server built with Python. The server retrieves files in the system that is in the same directory as this server file. If the file does not exist, error 404 is returned. The server-client connection is made over the TCP protocol.

## Usage

To run this project properly, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Add files that you want to retrieve to the repository
3. Cd to the directory where the server file is (the repository)
4. Type "python3 webserver.py" to run the server
5. Access the server through the browser by entering http://localhost:12000/{filename.ext}
6. To test this with the example file, type http://localhost:12000/index.html
